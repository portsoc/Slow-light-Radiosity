# Slow-light Radiosity

An adaptation of the Radiosity algorithm and implementation from Ashdown's ["Radiosity: A Programmer's Perspective"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/527751) (Ian Ashdown, 1994) in Javascript and with extensions to visualize slow propagation of light.

## Modules

* `radiosity/` contains the environment modeling classes, and the radiosity algorithms;
* `modeling/` contains classes for creating and loading various types of models;
* `frontend/` has a visualization environment and various tests
* `test/` has all unit tests
* `lib/` contains third-party libraries

Work in progress.
